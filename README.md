# Summer_Ryerson_Research_Project
This project was to create/develop a neural network from modifying an existing hand writing recognition NN to read graphs that contain 9 different sub-graphs with data that involves the vibrations of a milling machine to autonomously determine the health status of an end mill tool.

To look for the graphs for the data collected from the milling machine - Used the Milling data graphs. 
For the neural network  -- see the neural network1 zip and inside will contain the python code for the neural network in the SRC folder as well as the data input in the data folder.
